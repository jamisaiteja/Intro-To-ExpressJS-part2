1. Application Programming Interface (API)
    An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

    For example, OLA, and UBER use Google Maps API to provide their services.

    All the Network calls that we added are also the APIs.

2. Database
    Express apps can use any database supported by Node JS.

    There are many popular options, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB.

3. SQLite
    The SQLite provides a command-line tool sqlite3.

    It allows the user to enter and execute SQL statements against an SQLite database.

3.1 SQLite CLI
    3.1.1 Listing Existing Tables
        The .tables command is used to get the list of tables available in the SQLite database.

3.1.2 Selecting Table Data
    Syntax: SELECT * from <table>

4. SQLite Methods
    4.1 Open
        The SQLite open() method is used to connect the database server and provides a connection object to operate on the database.

        Syntax:
            open({
                filename: DATABASE_PATH,
                driver: SQLITE_DATABASE_DRIVER,
            });
        It returns a promise object. On resolving the promise object, we will get the database connection object.

    4.2 Executing SQL Queries
        SQLite package provides multiple methods to execute SQL queries on a database.

    Some of them are:

        all()
        get()
        run()
        exec(), etc.
        4.2.1 all()
        db.all(SQL_QUERY);

        The all() method is used to get multiple rows of data.

5. SQL Third-party packages
    We can use sqlite and sqlite3 node packages to connect SQLite Database from Node JS.

    Installation Commands:
        npm install sqlite --save
        npm install sqlite3 --save

6. Connecting SQLite Database from Node JS to get the books from Goodreads Website
    Install the SQL third-party packages sqlite and sqlite3.
    Initialize the SQLite Database


    6.1 SQLite Database Initialization
        const express = require("express");
        const path = require("path");

        const { open } = require("sqlite");
        const sqlite3 = require("sqlite3");
        const app = express();

        const dbPath = path.join(__dirname, "goodreads.db");

        let db = null;

        const initializeDBAndServer = async () => {
        try {
            db = await open({
            filename: dbPath,
            driver: sqlite3.Database,
            });
            app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log("Server Running at http://localhost:3000/");
            });
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(`DB Error: ${e.message}`);
            process.exit(1);
        }
        };

        initializeDBAndServer();


    6.2 Goodreads Get Books API
        app.get("/books/", async (request, response) => {
            const getBooksQuery = `
                SELECT
                *
                FROM
                book
                ORDER BY
                book_id;`;
            const booksArray = await db.all(getBooksQuery);
            response.send(booksArray);
        });
